# collatz-conjecture-python
small collatz conjecture program written in python

the collatz conjecture is a computationally unsolvable conjecture where the input number is multiplied by 3 and increased by 1 if odd, and divided by 2 if even. this process repeats until eventually it enters a loop of 4 to 2 to 1
